    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>White rice</li>
        <li>Oive oil</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>lamb</li>
        <li>Seasoning</li>
        <li>vegetables</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).</li>
        <li>Make the xawaash: In a medium bowl, combine the cumin, coriander, turmeric, cardamom, black pepper, cloves, and nutmeg. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat a medium oven-safe pan over medium-high heat. Add the vegetable oil, onion, tomato, garlic, and cinnamon stick. Cook until the onions have softened slightly, 5-6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Season with salt, then add the vegetable stock cube and cilantro. Cook for 1 minute, breaking up the stock cube.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium, then stir in the xawaash and soaked rice. Cook for about 3 minutes so rice grains lightly toast.</li>
        <li>Pour in the hot water and increase the heat to high to bring to a boil. Cover the pot, transfer to the oven, and bake for 20 minutes. Check periodically to be sure the rice has enough water.</li>
        <li>Remove the cooked rice from the oven and drizzle the red and orange food colorings on top. Gently mix so there are different colored grains.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the raisins over the hot rice, cover, and set aside.</li>
        <li>To prepare the topping, mix the potatoes with the orange food coloring in a medium bowl (wear gloves to avoid stained fingers!).</li>
        <li>Heat about 1 inch ( 2 cm) of oil in a large heavy-bottomed saucepan. Add the potatoes and cook for 5-6 minutes, then transfer to a baking sheet lined with paper towels to drain the excess oil.</li>
        <li>In the same oil, fry the onion slices until browned and crispy, 2-3 minutes. Add the red peppers cooking for an additional minute. Drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>To assemble the rice, transfer the pilaf to a large serving platter. Top with the fried potatoes, crispy onions, and red bell peppers.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!!</li>
