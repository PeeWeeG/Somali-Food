     <h3>Ingredients</h3>
     <ul>
        <li>1 cup white corn flour</li>
        <li>1/2 sorghum flour</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp instant dry yeast</li>
        <li>4 cups self raising flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>4 cups lukewarm water</li>
     </ul>
     <h3>Steps</h3>
     <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix the white corn meal, sorghum flour, yeast and half of the water, making sure it is properly combined. Leave for one hour.</li>
        <li>After one hour add in the self-rising flour and sugar, then slowly start adding the remaining water as you mix to get a smooth, lump-less texture for your batter.</li>
        <li>The key to achieving the classic anjero taste is fermentation. The mix should rest in a warm place to allow the fermentation to take place. The minimum time would be a few hours but to achieve a more authentic, sour anjero taste, you can let the batter ferment for up to two days. For this recipe you can let the batter ferment overnight.</li>
        <li>In a non-stick frying pan on a medium heat, ladle the batter mix into the pan according to preferred portion size, making sure that the batter spreads fully across the surface of the pan.</li>
        <li>Cover the pan and cook for a few minutes per portion. The desired colour is a golden brown, and the texture should be spongy with no liquid remaining.</li>
        <li>Plate the pancake and continue process until you each person has around 3 each.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate leftover batter and use for lunch or for tomorrowâ€™s b</li>
     </ol>
